# Stuck-in-a-loop
Challenge 1vs1 using Raylib creating a videogame in 1 week based on the theme "stuck in a loop"

## Description
You are lost, lost in a scary place, you can't see almost anything, you can't hear anything, you can't feel anything, you can't even remember anything. 

You are stuck in a loop, a loop of fear, a loop of pain, a loop of despair. You have to escape, you have to find a way out, you have to find the exit. 

But be careful, you are not alone, there are others like you, others that are stuck in the same loop, others that are trying to escape, others that will do anything to stop you. You have to be fast, you have to be smart, you have to be strong. 

You have to escape from only 3 rooms witch seems to be all want you got.

## How to play
- **Move:** `A` and `D` or `Left` and `Right` ⌨️

## Diary
📅 **Day 1:** added basic movement (left and right) also jump and physic (yk no flying around here)

📅 **Day 2:** organising the workspace (it was a mess). Added shooting and bullet loop physic (they have gravity!!). Added a basic enemy that follows you.
