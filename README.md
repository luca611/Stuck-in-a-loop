# Stuck-in-a-loop
#### Why I made this game?
Well this is a challange that me and my friend **[MrJoelao](https://github.com/MrJoelao)** wanted to do:<br>
*A 1vs1 using Ray lib c# where the point is to make a video game in just 1 week based on the theme "stuck in a loop"*

## Lore of the game 👻
*You are lost, lost in a scary place, you can't see almost anything, you can't hear anything, you can't feel anything, you can't even remember anything.*

*You are stuck in a loop, a loop of fear, a loop of pain, a loop of despair. You have to escape, you have to find a way out, you have to find the exit.*

*But be careful, you are not alone, there are others like you, others that are stuck in the same loop, others that are trying to escape, others that will do anything to stop you. You have to be fast, you have to be smart, you have to be strong.*

*You have to escape from only 3 rooms witch seems to be all want you got.*

## Diary 📕
- **📅 `Day 1`:** added basic movement (left and right) also jump and physic (yk no flying around 🪽)

- **📅 `Day 2`:** organising the workspace (it was a mess). Added shooting and bullet loop physic (they have gravity!!). Added a basic enemy that follows you.

- **📅 `Day 3`:** added a basic enemy system (they spawn in random places and follow you). Now enemies can die if shooted!, also added a basic Ui.

- **📅 `Day 4`:** added the player class (don't judge me I forgot to do it before). Added prop generator (it generates random props in the map). Added Game Over screen. **The player can now die.**

- **📅 `Day 5`:** added player animations (not the best I know, BUT it's something), also fixed the bug where the brake could be activated from anywhere in the map. added texture to every prop. brake included.

- **📅 `Day 6`:** Now props won't clip anymore with each other.
